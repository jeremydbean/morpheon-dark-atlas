# Morpheon Dark Atlas  

A customizable dark theme extension for ChatGPT Atlas. This extension ports the Morpheon Dark aesthetic to the Atlas browser and adds powerful controls for tuning page appearance.  

## Features  

- **Global dark mode**: Apply a consistent dark palette across pages without affecting text or images. Only the backgrounds and interface chrome are darkened to reduce eye strain.  
- **Preset themes**: Choose from curated color schemes including Morpheon Dark (the original palette), Charcoal, Slate, Midnight, and Obsidian.  
- **Per-site customization**: Write your own CSS rules for any site to override the global theme on a per-domain basis.  
- **Tabbed control panel**: The popup has General, Per‑Site, and Advanced tabs for easy access to settings.  
- **Fine‑tuning sliders**: Adjust brightness, contrast, and sepia tone in the Advanced tab for a personalized look.  
- **Icons included**: Custom icons (16×16, 48×48, and 128×128) for a polished extension appearance.
